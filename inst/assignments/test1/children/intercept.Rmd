```{r}
m = round(sum_stats$Mean,3)
b0 = round(m[2] - round(b1 * m[1], 3),3)
```

> We start with the fact that the point made up of both means, $(\bar{x}, \bar{y})$, is on the regression line, and that we've computed our slope $b_1 = `r b1`$.

\[
\begin{eqnarray}
\bar{y} &=& b_0 + b_1\bar{x}\\
`r m[2]` &=& b_0 + `r b1` \times `r m[1]`\\
`r m[2]` &=& b_0 + `r round(b1 * m[1], 3)`
\end{eqnarray}
\]

> We can now solve for $b_0$.

\[
\begin{eqnarray}
`r m[2]` &=& b_0 + `r round(b1 * m[1], 3)`\\
`r m[2]` - `r round(b1 * m[1], 3)` &=& b_0 \\
`r b0` &=& b_0 
\end{eqnarray}
\]

> Note that each step of the calculation was rounded to 3 digits. The intercept is `r b0`.
