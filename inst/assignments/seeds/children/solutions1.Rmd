### Solutions, block 1

This code chunk uses the `jitter` function, which uses the random number generator. 


```{r out.width="30%"}
x = 1:20
plot(x, jitter(x, factor = 3))
```

Because this child chunk was executed with the option `seed.status='reset'`, once the chunk has been executed the seed will be reset. This is important, because it is a "solution" chunk: it is only executed *sometimes*. We need the state of the random number generator in chunks after this one to be the same, regardless of whether this chunk is executed or not.
